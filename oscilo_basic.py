## SLLL-MKGO-002: Basic Oscilloscope
## SLLL-MKGO-002: demonstrates how to use the Oscilloscope instrument
### Pre-requisites: Connectivity verified to moku device per SLLL-MKGO-001

## We are just going to take the following for granted:  
## luguru, numpy, ...
import sys
import math
from loguru import logger
from moku.instruments import Oscilloscope
## End imports
## A note about logging:
## We are going to want to utilize the moku library's logging ability.
## But for now, consider that a #TODO
